# DSH Task Board plugin (dsh-task-board)

A port of the CodexFF project task board for **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)**: a new
`Chat → Trajectory → Task Board` tab in the conversation view, canvas-style
draggable panels, agent tools and a sync skill, with local JSON storage and no
external services.

## Features

- **Conversation view tab**: `Chat → Trajectory → Task Board` (`conversation.view`, order 20).
- **Canvas board**: one child panel per main task; panels are draggable with
  snap alignment (25px base gap, top-row alignment, auto horizontal centering
  for vertical stacks), collapsible; temporary tasks are color-marked.
- **Task model**: parent/child task tree, task boundaries
  (goal / scope / out of scope / acceptance), checkbox completion;
  a parent task auto-closes when all its subtasks are complete, and adding an
  incomplete child reopens all of its ancestors.
- **Agent tools** (same semantics as the CodexFF MCP server):
  - `board_get` / `board_revision` — read the board and its revision
  - `board_sync` — batch create/update tasks (supports `key` references in one call)
  - `task_create` / `task_update` / `task_delete` — single task operations
- **Skill**: `dsh-task-board` (task splitting and sync discipline), auto-loaded by the agent.
- **Storage**: `$DSH_HOME/taskboards/<sha256(project path)>.json`, CodexFF-compatible
  format; one atomically written JSON file per project.

## Installation

### Option 1: One command (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @etony668/dsh-task-board
```

Then open or refresh the DSH web UI — the `Task Board` tab appears after
`Trajectory`. The plugin is also listed in the plugin market (workflow category).

### Option 2: Clone from GitHub (backup)

**macOS / Linux (bash)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etony668/dsh-task-board.git
cd dsh-task-board
./install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/etony668/dsh-task-board.git
cd dsh-task-board
.\install.ps1
```

> Windows users can also run `./install.sh` from Git Bash (same result).

Then **refresh the DSH page** (or restart DSH) to see the `Task Board` tab.
If the tab does not appear after a refresh, restart DSH once — the patch always
applies at startup.

### Option 1b: One-click install from the plugin market

This plugin has been submitted for listing on
[awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com) (category `workflow`; takes
effect once merged). With the
[dsh-market](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market) plugin installed, open
DSH **Settings → Plugin Market**, search for `task-board` and install with one
click — no manual clone needed.

### Option 2: Manual install

1. Put this repository's contents into `~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-task-board/` (or any directory).
2. Run `./reinstall.sh` — it copies the package into the current runtime's
   `node_modules/@etony668/dsh-task-board/` and creates the profile fallback symlink.
3. Make sure `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml` contains (create it if missing):

   ```yaml
   - insert:
       - id: task-board
         name: '@etony668/dsh-task-board'
   ```

> `reinstall.sh` / `reinstall.ps1` auto-detect common DSH runtime directories on
> macOS / Windows / Linux. If detection fails, specify the path explicitly:
> - bash: `DSH_TASK_BOARD_RUNTIME="/path/to/runtime" ./reinstall.sh`
> - PowerShell: `.\reinstall.ps1 -RuntimeRoot "C:\path\to\runtime"`

## Usage

- Switch to the board via the top tab; there is **no back button** inside the
  board — go back with the top `Chat` tab, or via keyboard `Tab` / `Esc`
  (not hijacked while focus is in an input).
- The bottom message composer stays visible on the board view (local choice B);
  it floats above the canvas, so the board keeps full height.
- After task changes, the agent appends a clickable “view task board” link that
  switches to the board tab without a page refresh.

## Upgrade

A DSH upgrade creates a new runtime version directory; the `node_modules` copy
and the profile symlink must be rebuilt:

```bash
cd ~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-task-board && ./reinstall.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\plugins\dsh-task-board
.\reinstall.ps1
```

`cordis.patch.yml` lives in `~/.dsh` and is unaffected by upgrades.

## Uninstall

```bash
# 1) Remove the plugin row from the patch (edit ~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml, drop the - insert: part)
# 2) Delete the source and runtime copies
rm -rf ~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-task-board
rm -rf <runtime>/versions/*/node_modules/@etony668/dsh-task-board
rm -f  ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/@etony668/dsh-task-board
# 3) Data (optional): ~/.dsh/taskboards/*.json
```

## Repository layout

```
index.js        package root entry (loader resolves <pkg>/index.js; re-exports lib/index.js)
lib/index.js    host plugin (node ESM): storage + tools + skill + /api/task-board route
lib/client.js   web plugin bundle (hand-built __ModuleLoader__, react only)
package.json    dsh.client: { platform: web }, exports ./client; dsh.bundle patch
install.sh      one-click install (copy + install + patch write; macOS/Linux bash)
install.ps1     one-click install (Windows PowerShell)
reinstall.sh    reinstall into runtime node_modules + profile fallback symlink (bash)
reinstall.ps1   reinstall (Windows PowerShell)
```

## Development

The plugin follows the DSH dual-end structure: the host side (Node ESM) provides
storage/tools/skill/route, and the client side (browser bundle) registers the
`conversation.view` tab and renders the board. After changes, run `./install.sh`
and refresh the page; host-side changes need a DSH restart.
